Thinkpad research
*********************************

- IBM Sold Thinkpad to Lenovo at the end of 2005
	- all thinkpads from 2006 and on were designed by Lenovo
- x32 and x41 were the last x-series laptops designed by IBM
	- x32 was discontinued within months of release
- It seems that the x230 was the last of x series with easily removable hard drive
- i don't think i like the x240 it looks windows 8ish
